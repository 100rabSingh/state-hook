What are Hooks?
=> Hooks are a new feature addition in React 16.8 which allow you to use react features without having to write a class.
=> Hooks are a special Function which lets you hook into react Features
ex: State of a Component

# Hooks Don't work inside Classes

Why Hooks?
 - Reason set 1
	=> Understand how this keyword works in Javascript
	=> Remember to bind event handlers in class components
	=> Classess don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable

 - Reason set 2
	=> There is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
	=> HOC and render props patterns do address this problem
	=> Makes code harder to follow
	=> There is a need to share stateful logic in a better way

 - Reason set 3
	=> create components for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events.
	=> Related code is not organized in one place but scattered into different lifecycle
	   methods
	=> Ex: Data Fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
	=> Ex: Event Listeners - In ComponentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
	=> Because of stateful Logic- Cannot break components into smaller ones

# Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know like props, state, context, render and lifecycles.

Rules of Hooks
 => "Only call Hooks at the top level"
    Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
 => "Only call Hooks from React Functions"
    Call them from within React Functional Components and not just ant refular javascript functions.
